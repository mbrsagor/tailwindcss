                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
                ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including Lorem Ipsum.

            <h1>User stories != developer stories</h1>

            <p class="text-sm">What is the difference? A user story is something a customer wants to achieve, whereas technical tasks are the little things that need to be done before the customer can achieve his or her goal. In other words, you should not convert every request in the backlog into user stories. Instead, have a larger user story that encompasses several technical tasks. <br />See the difference? We don’t describe (or prescribe) implementation details, but instead, focus on what the user wants to achieve. This story is not actionable enough and needs to be split into multiple technical tasks. But most importantly, it acts as a guiding light, a clear test if we are moving in the right direction.</p>
